The objective of this project, part of the [NestJS Fundamentals course](https://courses.nestjs.com/), is to learn the core principles behind NestJS by building a small REST API all about coffee.

You can find all of my notes about the course [here](https://github.com/mathcrln/garden/tree/main/courses/NestJS%20Fundamentals).
